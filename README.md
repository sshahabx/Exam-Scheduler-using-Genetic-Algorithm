# Exam-Scheduler-using-Genetic-Algorithm

This program employs genetic algorithm which is an evolutionary algorithm to generate a best schedule using the data provided in the four csv files.
Their are five hard constraints which the code has to fullfill, if a schedule generated in a population does not fulfill this then its fitness score is deducted.
The best schedule is stored in a new csv file.

To run this unzip these files in the same folder and then execute it in a jupyter  notebook or copy the code written in the notebook file and run it in VScode.
Libraries used : pandas and numpy


You can edit the number of generations and population size from the arguments passed in the genetic algorithm function.
